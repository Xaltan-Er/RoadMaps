Basic Introduction

Full-stack developers are the backbone of modern software teams, bravely connecting the dots between what users see and the powerful systems working behind the scenes. They’re not “just” frontend developers, nor they’re “just” backend devs, instead, they tackle the full spectrum. From designing intuitive interfaces to crafting efficient web server logic, they juggle multiple responsibilities, making their role one of the most versatile—and critical—in the tech industry.

If you’re aiming for a full-stack role, you’ll need to prove you’ve got the skills to handle it all.
